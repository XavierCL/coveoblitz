#Coveo Blitz 2017 - Node Starter Pack

##Installation
1. Node should already be installed on your computer. If not, heads to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Type `npm install` to install the project dependencies

##Usage
Open the *config.json* file and replace `INSERT_TEAM_KEY_HERE` with your team key. The serverUrl might need to be modified, be sure that it **does not** end with a slash.

###Training
Simply type `npm test` or `node bot.js -t 1 config.json` to run your bot in training mode. This will start a new game on a random map with 3 bots moving randomly. 
It will also open your default browser so you can see the game.

You can also use custom maps (m1 to m6) by using the `map` parameter. E.g., `npm run test:map m1` or `node bot.js -t 1 --map m1 config.json`.

You can also specify the number of turns by using the `turns` parameter. E.g., `node bot.js -t 1 --turns 50 config.json` to use game of 50 turns.

The `t` parameter specify the number of runs, should always be 1.

You can kill the run at any moment with a *SIGINT* (or ctrl+c)

##Evaluation Round
Be sure to be ready for the evaluation round. You can run them from your computer, but we recommend you to use the provided VM.

We will provide you with a gameId that you'll need to queue for a game.

Replace `INSERT_GAME_ID_HERE` with the gameId in `npm run evaluation INSERT_GAME_ID_HERE` or `node bot.js -a --id INSERT_GAME_ID_HERE config.json`

Don't leave the game or your bot will stay at its emplacement for the rest of the game.

##Additional Informations
The map parsing is already done for you. Feel free to modify it if you need to.
 
The files in the **client** folder shouldn't be modified. If you do modify them, we won't be responsible of what happens.  

Have fun!
